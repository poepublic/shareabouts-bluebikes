<p>{{#_}}As Metro Boston's publicly owned bike share system, Bluebikes is a
healthy, green, and affordable public transportation option that connects our
communities. With a network of over 4,500 bikes and more than 480 stations
across Arlington, Boston, Brookline, Cambridge, and our other municipal
partners, we're dedicated to providing a reliable and equitable way to get
around.{{/_}}</p>

<p>{{#_}}To help us grow, we invite you to suggest new station locations. Your
input is essential as we work with our partner municipalities to decide where to
expand the network. Let us know where a new Bluebikes station would best serve
you and your community, helping to make our system even more convenient and
connecting for all riders.{{/_}}</p>
