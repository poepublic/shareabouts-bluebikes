local expertise and let us know where you think we should add or expand stations
to the Bluebikes system. Existing stations are identified with a blue

  <ul style="margin-bottom: 0;">
    <li>{{#_}}Suggestions do not guarantee a station; rather, suggestions are helpful feedback to augment existing processes that determine where and when new stations are added or expanded.{{/_}}</li>
    <li>{{#_}}Most of our stations are 42–52’ long and 6’ wide.{{/_}}</li>
    <li>{{#_}}For durability and easy maintenance, we prefer level hardscape (concrete, brick, or asphalt) in public spaces with at least 4 hours of direct sunlight daily. If hardscape is unavailable, our team may be able to install concrete pads.{{/_}}</li>
    <li>{{#_}}Stations can also be placed on low-traffic, low-speed streets, ideally next to bike lanes.{{/_}}</li>
    <li>{{#_}}Please identify any utility covers or maintenance holes, as stations cannot be installed over them.{{/_}}</li>
    <li>{{#_}}Sites on federal, state, or private property require approval from the government or property owner and may need additional permissions{{/_}}</li>
